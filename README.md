# Client Manage

## Overview
The **Client Manage** application is a React.js frontend project for managing customer records within an ERP system.  
It allows users to add new customers, update existing customer details, and ensures each customer is assigned a **unique client code** generated by a custom algorithm.  
The app also features a **login system** and an **admin panel** where administrators can create and manage user accounts.  

The frontend communicates with a backend API service (see [Client Manage API](https://github.com/agshinzada/mz-client-manage-api)) for data storage and ERP integration.  
For administration tasks, the project integrates with a separate admin panel (see [Client Manage Admin Panel]([mz-sys-manage-erp](https://github.com/agshinzada/mz-sys-manage-erp))).
